# Beer Can Race Tracker
This race tracker was developped with the objective of providing an easy way for boat willing to commit their data and compare it against others.

All you need to do is to download a GPS logger for your Android or IPhone and send the data after each race to chicago.beercanracing@gmail.com

The live website is available at http://chicago-beercanracing.github.io/tracker/
