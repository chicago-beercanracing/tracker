                    </h3>
                    <p>This app works nicely but requires a few steps to setup properly in order to track the race.</p>
                    <p>First after you install the app, click on the top left button to access the settings:</p>
                    <img src="images/android-main.png" width="400px" alt="top left button">
                    <p>Once in the settings we'll go in each section to set a few parameters:</p>
                    <img src="images/android-menu.png" width="400px" alt="settings menu">
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Logging details - Log To GPX<br>
                            Swipe to the right to activate logging to GPX</li>
                            <li>Logging details - Log to KML, Log to Custom URL, Log to OpenGTS Server, Log to Plain Text, Log to NMEA<br>
                            Swipe to the left to disable logging in these file formats.</li>
                            <li>Logging details - New File Create<br>
                            I recommend setting it to 'Every time I start'</li>
                            <li>Performance - Location Providers<br>
                            Set to GPS, disabling network is better because on the water Network positions are going to be very bad anyway and ignored on the website.</li>
                            <li>Performance - Time Before Logging<br>
                            I set it to 2 seconds, this is the interval at which the GPS chip in your phone will be activated and wait for a fix.
                            It'll probably sampled down to 5 sec interval on the website, but better log a little more than too few data points. </li>
                            <li>Performance - Keep GPS on between fixes<br>
                            I recomend to set it ON, the positions are going to be much better. Otheriwse it'll turn the GPS on and off all the time, <br>which will lengthen the time the GPS chip needs to aquire a fix on your position.</li>
                            <li>Performance - Distance Filter<br>
                            Set it to 1 meter, this is going to be the minimal resolution of your data</li>
                            <li>Performance - Accuracy Filter<br>
                                I set it to 5 meters. This is the expected GPS precision before a point is recorded.<br>
                                If your phone does not log any positions or seems slow, enter a higher value such as 8, then 10.<br>
                                By entering a higher value, you leave more room for error on your GPS fix.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>It is best to start logging like 30 min ahead of the start, and stop as soon as possible after the race.</p>
                    <p>The smaller the file size the faster it can be added to the website, if you log for the whole day, I'll have to find beginning and ends of the race among your log which takes some time.</a>
